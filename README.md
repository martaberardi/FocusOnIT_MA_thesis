# Focus On IT
Focus on IT (https://www.focus-on-it-app.com/) is a language learning web app tailored to adult migrants learning Italian as L2/FL.

The goal of the app is to constitute a supporting tool for autonomous language learning, an additional didactic aid particularly tailored to users who intend to practice grammatical knowledge. Such practice is carried out through exercises providing scaffolding and adaptive feedback, specifically designed to promote the application of both inductive and deductive learning strategies.
The purpose behind the the app's architecture  is to foster the development of language awareness and metalinguistic reflection through activities which draw the user's attention towards specific linguistic features.
